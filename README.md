# A-B-testing
Data Analysis - A/B Testing
A/B testing is performed to compare and determine two versions of web page or application. It is also known as split testing or bucket testing.

# Summary
This project is performed as a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. A comparison between two versions of an e-commerce website is made to determine if the new version of the website had to be implemented or the old version of the website had to be retained.

# Data wrangling
Gather - ab_data.csv and countries.csv were loaded into Jupyter Notebook
Assess- The datasets were checked if they were clean and tidy. Duplicates rows were dropped and aligned.
Test - The dataset was tested to be complete

# Analysis
The probability of converting was calculated for 3 instances such as converting irrespective of the page, converting if an individual received treatment or converting if an individual received control.
To derive a conclusion, hypotheses testing and logistic regression were carried out and p-values were determined.

# Conclusion
Based on the various tests performed, p-values have been calculated and conclusions and findings are drawn
